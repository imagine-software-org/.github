## Mission

We empower students to build the future through real-world software development and design projects. Our goal is to help members ship products with a club built like a startup studio. By joining focused teams and moving fast with mentors, you build work you are proud to show.

- **Build Together:** Teams mix roles so you learn from real collaboration and shared ownership.
- **Ship with Guidance:** Mentors help you plan, review, and finish work that feels complete.
- **Grow Your Story:** Leave with projects, demos, and results you can explain clearly.

## Projects

Each cycle focuses on projects that help the campus or local community:

- **Campus Apps:** Tools for student life like study planning, club events, and housing guides.
- **Local Impact:** Software and sites built for small organizations.
- **Open Source:** Libraries and templates that help new builders get started.
- **Research Tools:** Dashboards and data tools that help labs share results.

## Alumni
